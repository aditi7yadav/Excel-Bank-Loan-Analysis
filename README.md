# Bank Loan Report Project

## Overview

The **Bank Loan Report** project provides insights into the bank’s loan performance by tracking key metrics and visualizing trends across different loan parameters. The goal of this project is to enable data-driven decision-making, identify patterns in loan data, and assess the bank’s lending activities and portfolio health.

## Key Features:
* **Loan Performance Monitoring**: Metrics like total loan applications, funded amounts, and repayments.
* **Loan Status Analysis**: Differentiating between ‘Good Loans’ and ‘Bad Loans’ based on loan status (e.g., 'Fully Paid' vs. 'Charged Off').
* **Regional & Trend Insights**: Visualization of loan performance over time and across different regions and loan types.
* **Comprehensive Reporting**: Displaying data through various chart types for better clarity.

## Dashboards

### Dashboard 1: Loan Performance Summary

This dashboard provides a snapshot of critical loan-related metrics, including:

* **Total Loan Applications**: Tracks the number of applications received.
* **Total Funded Amount**: Monitors funds disbursed across loans.
* **Total Amount Received**: Evaluates repayments made by borrowers.
* **Average Interest Rate & DTI**: Shows average values across loans to track financial health.
* **Loan Health**: Classifies loans into 'Good Loans' (fully paid and current) and 'Bad Loans' (charged off) with key metrics for each category.

### Dashboard 2: Visualizing Loan Trends

Visualizations are used to track key trends and gain actionable insights:

* **Monthly Trends (Line Chart)**: Tracks loan applications, funded amounts, and repayments over time.
* **Regional Breakdown (Filled Map)**: Shows loan performance by state.
* **Loan Term Distribution (Donut Chart)**: Breaks down loans by their term lengths.
* **Employee Length Impact (Bar Chart)**: Analyzes the impact of borrower employment length on loan metrics.
* **Loan Purpose Breakdown (Bar Chart)**: Visualizes loan purposes like debt consolidation and refinancing.
* **Home Ownership Influence (Tree Map)**: Displays how home ownership status impacts loan performance.

## Data Collection & Loan Granting Process

* **Data Sources**: Loan applications, credit reports, internal bank records, and third-party data.
* **Loan Process**: Steps from loan application review to disbursement, repayment, and ongoing monitoring.

## Why This Report is Important

* **Risk Assessment**: Evaluates the creditworthiness of borrowers and predicts potential defaults.
* **Decision-making**: Supports the approval or denial of loan applications using data-driven analysis.
* **Portfolio Management**: Helps banks track the health of their loan portfolios and adjust strategies.
* **Fraud Detection**: Identifies suspicious loan applications and activities.
* **Customer Insights**: Provides data to understand customer behavior, enabling better loan products and services.
